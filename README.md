# FoodSaviour

<h3>ABOUT OUR WEBSITE:</h3>
*Our site provides a platform where merchants from various restaurants and hotels can sell the excess food at a discounted price and also our site  provides the best way to prevent wastage of excess food from functions and events by donating them to the needy.
*We got this idea of selling food at a discounted price by realizing the sufferings of people without their work and restaurants without enough sales during the pandemic time. So, we made a site that could benefit both the common people and the restaurant.

<h3>ABOUT OUR ZOBOT:</h3>
*First, with a greeting message, our zobot will get your information and it will be stored in a third-party sheet (google spreadsheet).
*You will be given two suggestions, according to your preference you can choose one.
*Then the bot will ask you to enable your location in order to find the nearest location of restaurant/old age homes/children orphanage/schools for physically challenged .
*Then the zobot will ask a few questions about your order which includes the headcount of the people, order amount, veg/non-veg, and your email id.
*After that zobot will give you a link, where you have to verify your email-id (we have used zoho forms for OTP verification) .
*At last you will get an email about your delivery partner and the summary of your order.
